			By generating a network-based representation of laws, regulations, policies and procedures (collectively defined here as "rulesets") that enables traversal of rules from their high-level origin through to the operational practices of government agencies, <b>PolicyNet</b> enables policy makers better understand the connective structure of their rulesets.

						<p class="md-subhead text-justified">A myriad of laws, regulations, policies and procedures ("rulesets") governs how government agencies conduct their business practices and relate to the citizens they are charged with serving. These constantly evolving rulesets are so intertwined and interdependent that the operational impact of changes or additions to them are often poorly understood or appreciated at both the legislative and operational stage.</p>
						<p class="md-subhead text-justified">Thus, policy makers face significant difficulty in relaying information to the citizens in a timely, understanable fashion to gather feedback and identify conflicts that are not readily visible.</p>
						<p class="md-subhead text-justified">The above has resulted in citizens (and advocates) becoming increasingly frustrated by the ambiguity of rulesets, which are time consuming to understand and costly to comply.</p>

						<span class="md-display-1 head">Rules have nested hierarchies</span>
						<p class="md-subhead text-justified">Within the complex policy rulesets, interconnections and interdependencies exist between different rule types to link citizens, policy makers, and upper branches of government.</p>
						<p class="md-subhead text-justified">Thus, the ability to intuitively and efficienctly traverse these interdependencies requires the development of methodology to intelligently ingest, query, and present revelant portions of the overall network.</p>
